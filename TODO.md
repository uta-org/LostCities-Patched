I need to change the ground level depending on the height to the ground
I need to change walls
I need to adapt the heightmap implementation
And there is like 4-5 methods I'm not calling yet
Until I solve at least the ground level, the walls and heightmap (most 
important)
There is some usages I don't like, for example the author put blocks 
until bedrock level, he didn't calculated the exact height of buildings
So this impl obviously will not work in CC
Also I need to look after T121 roads, to make a more coherent generation
